Here‚Äôs an updated version of the **GitHub README** and description for LunaVM, incorporating **MoonlightScript** and its role in the overall system. I've expanded the explanation to highlight how MoonlightScript, the compiler (MLSC), and LunarVM all tie together:

### **GitHub Short Description**
üåï **LunaVM** ‚Äì A lightweight virtual machine with a custom memory allocator and MoonlightScript integration, designed for executing compiled opcodes or creating an extensible virtualized platform for 2D and 3D applications! üöÄ‚ú®

### **GitHub README**

# üåô LunaVM

Welcome to **LunaVM**, a unique virtual machine built from scratch in **C**, designed to execute **MoonlightScript** programs, manage memory efficiently, and act as a foundation for a lightweight operating system or a virtualized platform. üöÄ

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Features

### **1. MoonlightScript Integration**
LunaVM serves as the runtime environment for **MoonlightScript**, a statically typed, lightweight programming language designed to create system-level applications for LunarVM. MoonlightScript compiles to LunarVM opcodes, which the VM executes, providing a seamless bridge between high-level scripting and low-level execution.

Key features of MoonlightScript:
- Static typing with type inference.
- Clean, intuitive syntax for systems programming.
- Compiles to binary opcodes for LunarVM (`.lvmb` format).
- MoonlightScript programs can manipulate memory, render graphics, and even build multi-app systems.

---

### **2. Custom Memory Management with Starlock**
LunaVM uses a custom-built **Starlock allocator** for dynamic memory management. Unlike traditional `malloc`-based allocation, Starlock:
- Allocates memory in arenas to prevent fragmentation.
- Tracks ownership and lifetimes of memory blocks to minimize memory leaks.
- Ensures optimal performance for LunarVM programs.

---

### **3. Lightweight Virtual Machine**
LunaVM interprets opcodes generated by the **MoonlightScript Compiler (MLSC)** and executes them in a secure, isolated environment. The VM provides:
- A fetch-decode-execute cycle to handle instructions.
- A stack-based and register-based hybrid architecture for flexibility.
- Built-in support for key opcodes like `MOV`, `ADD`, `PRINT`, `HLT`.

---

### **4. Graphics Rendering with Raylib (Planned Integration)**
Future versions of LunaVM will support **Raylib** to enable rendering of 2D/3D graphics directly from MoonlightScript programs, making it possible to:
- Create windowed or fullscreen applications with dynamic content.
- Develop interactive 3D games or simulations.
- Bind MoonlightScript functions to Raylib‚Äôs rendering pipeline.

---

## üöÄ System Architecture

### **MoonlightScript Workflow**
The development pipeline for LunaVM applications looks like this:

1. **Write MoonlightScript Code**  
   Example `example.mls`:
   ```moonlightscript
   fun main() (Void) {
     var message: String = "Hello, Lunar World!";
     print(message);
   }
   ```

2. **Compile with MoonlightScript Compiler (MLSC)**  
   - Generates `.lvmb` (binary) and `.lvs` (source-debug) files:
     - `.lvmb`: Binary file of opcodes for LunarVM.
     - `.lvs`: Optional source file for debugging and introspection.

3. **Run on LunaVM**  
   - Load the `.lvmb` file into LunaVM‚Äôs memory and execute:
     ```bash
     lunarvm example.lvmb
     ```

## üåü Virtual Machine Highlights

1. **Opcodes**
   LunaVM currently supports the following opcodes:
   - `MOV`: Move data into registers.
   - `ADD`: Perform arithmetic.
   - `PRINT`: Display strings or numbers.
   - `HLT`: Halt execution.

   Example LunarVM program in assembly-like pseudocode:
   ```
   0x01 0x01 0x10 // MOV R1, 0x10
   0x02 0x01 0x01 // ADD R1, R1
   0x03           // PRINT R1
   0xFF           // HLT
   ```

2. **Memory Management**
   - **Starlock** provides efficient allocation with ownership models and arena-based allocation.
   - LunarVM‚Äôs memory can be extended dynamically via Starlock, enabling applications to manage memory flexibly.

3. **Planned Multitasking**
   - LunaVM will eventually support multiple loaded programs in separate memory spaces, enabling multitasking.

---

## üåå The Vision

The long-term goal of LunaVM is to evolve into a **general-purpose virtual operating system** capable of running multitasking applications, integrating features like:
- A basic task scheduler to manage multiple processes.
- Networking capabilities for communication between applications.
- A file management system for `.lvmb` binaries and data.

---

## üî≠ Example Use Case

1. **MoonlightScript Application Development**  
   Write applications like games, utilities, or simulations using MoonlightScript.

2. **Virtualized Operating System**  
   Build a lightweight OS using MoonlightScript to run multiple `.lvmb` programs concurrently on LunarVM.

3. **Graphics and Game Development**  
   Integrate Raylib to build interactive games or dynamic simulations in MoonlightScript.
